# CYT (Customize Your Travel)
You can create your own travel course based on data from Naver's 'Places to Watch'. Each date is rendered in a different colored polyline and can be adjusted by dragging and dropping. The data that can be selected are divided into categories such as sightseeing spots, restaurants, and shopping, and it is a service that enables a more pleasant travel plan.
